        Bestiary: {
            Deviantt: Provides monster spawners and (if she feels like it) a helping hand. This upbeat and energetic creature likes money almost as much as she likes violence. Only a little deformed.
            Abominationn: Can control the weather and stop invasions, but he's lazy and his weapons are fused to his hands. Good thing he doesn't need to eat and doors magically open when he approaches.
            Mutant: Called brother by its siblings, but refuses to confirm its gender. More interested in watching fights and small pets than talking about its past. It seems to be looking for someone strong...
            LumberJack: A wholly ordinary lumberjack that loves collecting critters and chopping wood of any kind. But could there be more to him than meets the eye? Secret godly powers? ...Probably not.
            Squirrel: This dapper critter sells duplicates of valuable items that it notices in inventories. Won't divulge how it gets them, mostly because it can't speak.

                Content: I'm feeling good!
                NoHome: Do you have any spare housing? Please? Anything? Even a jail cell is fine with me!
                LoveSpace: Peace and quiet means I get to live it up!
                FarFromHome: I think my house was that way... unless you're taking me somewhere?
                DislikeCrowded: The more the merrier and all, but I'm starting to feel a lil' overcrowded.
                HateCrowded: I can't kick my legs out and relax without hitting someone...
                LikeBiome: "Ha ha ha, something about {BiomeName} just makes me laugh uncontrollably for some reason!"
                LoveBiome: The stars above are so pretty, I love watching them go by so much!
                DislikeBiome: Can we go somewhere warmer than this?
                HateBiome: I wanna live elsewhere! This is awful, I'm sweating up a storm!
                LikeNPC: "{NPCName} is my big-but-not-biggest bro. He's pretty cool!"
                LikeNPC_Princess: "I gotta visit {NPCName} again sometime, there's a girl who gets me!"
                LoveNPC: "{NPCName} is here! That's my big bro, isn't he just the coolest?!"
                DislikeNPC: "I can't stand girls like {NPCName}, feels like she's just here for a certain audience."
                HateNPC: "Just between us. Have you ever considered throwing {NPCName} back where you found him?"
            }

            Abominationn: {
                Content: I am content.
                NoHome: Give me a home and I'll lower my prices.
                LoveSpace: Not being crowded around is good.
                FarFromHome: I'd fly back to my house, but I don't really feel like being watched.
                DislikeCrowded: There's too many humans around, they keep poking at my face.
                HateCrowded: Do you know how hard it is to carry a scythe and not cut anyone with this many people around?
                LikeBiome: "I like {BiomeName}, it's home to a fine opponent with my brother's wings."
                LoveBiome: "I like Space a lot, we came here first before landing."
                DislikeBiome: "Too many weak enemies live in {BiomeName}."
                HateBiome: "I dislike {BiomeName} a lot."
                LikeNPC: "{NPCName} is my sister... I've defeated more events than her, but she's okay."
                LikeNPC_Princess: "{NPCName} is okay."
                LoveNPC: "{NPCName} is my brother... I've fought more bosses than him, but he's strong."

                HateNPC: "{NPCName} ruins the glory of battle, I don't want her near me."

            Mutant: {
                Content: Thanks for the house, I guess.
                NoHome: A house wouldn't hurt, but I don't mind either way.
                LoveSpace: Downtime between boss fights is nice. I don't get that with lots of humans around.
                FarFromHome: I'll eat slimes and zombies, but eating human food at home would be good too.
                DislikeCrowded: There's too many people here. And they seem upset I keep winning our staring contests.
                HateCrowded: If one more human in this cramped town bumps into my brain again... never mind.
                LikeBiome: "We all start in {BiomeName}, it's a good place."
                LoveBiome: "Living up here is comfortable, but when are you going to find my temple?"
                DislikeBiome: "Is {BiomeName} supposed to impress me? The big fairy doesn't, that's for sure."
                HateBiome: "Do you want pricier summons? Making me live in {BiomeName} means pricier summons."
                LikeNPC: "I forget when {NPCName} joined the family, but she's earned her place."
                LikeNPC_Princess: "{NPCName} seems friendly."
                LoveNPC: "{NPCName} and I fought through many battles, too bad there's no opportunity to do it again."
                DislikeNPC: "Why is {NPCName} here? It's okay, me, just don't look him in the eye and he can't scare you..."
                HateNPC: "{NPCName} needs to leave before my Penetrator makes it happen."
            }

            LumberJack: {
                Content: I'm happy as long as the world has wood that needs chopping.
                NoHome: No lumberjack is complete without a log cabin to call home!
                LoveSpace: Fewer people around means I can swing my axe all I want with nobody in the way.
                FarFromHome: This is too far from my cabin. I should get back and sharpen my axe.
                DislikeCrowded: I think it's getting crowded around here.
                HateCrowded: Too many people around. Nothing ruins a good chopping session more than chopping down someone.
                LikeBiome: "Plenty of trees to chop in {BiomeName} makes for a happy lumberjack."
                LoveBiome: "There's nothing like good old fashioned woodchopping in {BiomeName}!"
                DislikeBiome: "There's nothing to chop in {BiomeName}!"
                HateBiome: "There's nothing to chop in {BiomeName}!"
                LikeNPC: "I chop down trees, {NPCName} plants more, we're the perfect duo."
                LikeNPC_Princess: "{NPCName} is better with an axe than I expected!"
                LoveNPC: "I'm glad {NPCName} understands the beauty of felling a big tree."
                DislikeNPC: "{NPCName} told me to start hugging trees... so I taught my axe to hug trees for me."
                HateNPC: "{NPCName} doesn't get me at all. Bombing a forest isn't woodchopping!"
